description 

this is my capstone project for specializations. at this point in time i am a student at dev mountain in the f12 cohort i will be using react apis and hooks to build a fullstack weather application for my capstone project. for functionality the app should be able to ask for a location and then give you information based on said location, if i dont build a full database i will probably just do a mock database with a set amount of locations, well see i havent decided yet. this application will be using css modules, react.js, and hooks, and axios for the back end.
